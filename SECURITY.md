## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/monkeypants/cli-owm/security/advisories/new) of this repository and click "Report a vulnerability".

This ensures the issue is handled privately until a fix is available.
