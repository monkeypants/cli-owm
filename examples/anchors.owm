// Who Are You Serving?
//
// STORM has three stakeholders pulling on the same value chain:
// shipping lines want cheap traction, the Supreme Leader wants a
// flying sailboat, and maritime regulators want safety compliance.
// Each anchor distorts priorities differently.
//
// A map with one user is a map with one opinion.  Multiple anchors
// reveal the political forces that shape every technical decision
// at STORM.
