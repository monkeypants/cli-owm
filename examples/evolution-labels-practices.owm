// How Practices Mature
//
// Activities aren't the only things that evolve — practices do too.
// A Novel practice differentiates you; a Best practice commoditises.
// STORM's boom-pop decommissioning is still Novel (nobody else does it).
// Hydrogen replenishment is approaching Best — the procedures are
// documented and repeatable across the fleet.
//
// When a practice becomes Best, it stops being a competitive weapon.
// STORM invests in Novel practices and lets Best practices run on
// process discipline.  The boom-pop is Novel; hydrogen replenishment
// is Best.  Fund accordingly.
