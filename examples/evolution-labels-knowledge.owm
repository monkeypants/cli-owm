// How Knowledge Matures
//
// Knowledge evolves from Concept through Hypothesis and Theory to
// Accepted.  STORM's R&D risk follows this curve: autonomous flight
// control is still at the Concept stage — unproven and expensive.
// Kite aerodynamics is Accepted science, low risk.
//
// R&D spend concentrates at the Concept end.  If the lab is spending
// research budget on Accepted knowledge, they're doing engineering,
// not research — and the Supreme Leader will reorganise accordingly.
