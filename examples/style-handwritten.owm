// The Napkin Sketch
//
// The Supreme Leader's original pitch, sketched on a napkin at a
// harbour bar.  Now framed in breakout room B.  Every strategy
// starts messy, visionary, and incomplete.  The handwritten style
// is honest about that — it says "this is a hypothesis, not a plan."
//
// The first map of any new initiative should look exactly this rough.
// If the first draft is polished, someone drew what they wanted to
// see rather than what they actually know.
