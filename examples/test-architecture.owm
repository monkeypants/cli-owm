// Mapping the Quality Infrastructure
//
// This map describes the test suite that verifies the tool that
// renders this map.  The recursion is intentional.
//
// Quality infrastructure is a value chain.  The developer needs
// confidence; confidence depends on tests; tests depend on
// components at different stages of maturity.  The creative STORM
// examples at the bottom left are genesis artefacts — handcrafted,
// irreducible, and resistant to change because every golden-file
// snapshot depends on their exact content.  The coordinate functions
// at the bottom right are pure commodity maths.
//
// The components that give the most confidence are often the ones
// least understood.  What in the quality infrastructure is genesis
// and what is commodity?  This map answers that question about itself.

annotation 1 [[0.28, 0.15]] STORM examples are genesis — creative, irreducible, the source of all fixtures
annotation 2 [0.35, 0.82] Coordinate maths is commodity — pure functions any graphics system has
