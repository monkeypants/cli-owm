// Sourcing Follows Evolution
//
// STORM's sourcing strategy maps directly to evolution.  The Hydrogen
// Envelope is Genesis — nobody sells dirigible-grade envelopes, so STORM
// builds it in-house.  Avionics are a mature Product — buy off the shelf.
// Cloud Hosting is Commodity — outsource to a provider.
//
// The Tether System shows a sourcing pivot: built in-house today but
// evolving toward a buy decision as the market matures.
//
// The rule is simple: Genesis means build (no alternative exists),
// Product means buy (a competitive market exists), Commodity means
// outsource (it's a utility).  If sourcing doesn't match evolution,
// someone is either overspending or underinvesting.
