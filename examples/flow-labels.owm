// STORM's Q3 funding review.  All flows must be approved by Finance.
// Labelled flows reveal the economic structure: traction fees flow
// from shipping lines to Commercial, laundered funds circulate through
// offshore accounts and shell corporations, and the Stolen Art Vault
// serves as collateral for kite parts.
//
// Memo from Finance: label the flows.  "Data," "money," "requests,"
// and "laundered funds" move differently through a value chain.
// Unlabelled arrows hide the question: what exactly is flowing here?
